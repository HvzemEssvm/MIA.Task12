## This repository includes the followingâ¬‡:
1. PID Directory Named `turtlebot_pid` in `shato_ws/src`
2. Kinematics Directory Named `kinematics`
3. PID-turtlebot branch includes the package of PID controlling but with dynamic changing for K values (It isn't working)
4. Branch Named ``Select_Motors`` Regarding Task 12.2

### PID Controlling with shato
The package includes a Python script which control the movement of the robot to go to a specific target position and decrease its velocity near the target position until it stops.
